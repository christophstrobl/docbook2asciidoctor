== Convert docbook to asciidoctor

This script uses Spring Boot CLI to convert an existing set of docbook manuals to asciidoctor.

To run:

----
$ spring run docbook2asciidoctor.groovy <file1.xml> <file2.xml> <file3.xml>
----

It will print out a lot of debug information, but the above command will eventually produce:

* file1.ad
* file2.ad
* file3.ad

The target folder will be your current path.
